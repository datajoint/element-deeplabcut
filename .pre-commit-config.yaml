          # E203 - Colons should not have any space before them.
          #        Needed for list indexing
          # E501 - Line lengths are recommended to be no greater than 79 characters.
          #        Needed as we conform to 88
          # W503 - Line breaks should occur after the binary operator.
          #        Needed because not compatible with black
          # W605 - a backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence now
          #        generates a DeprecationWarning. This will eventually become a SyntaxError.
          #        Needed because we use \d as an escape sequence
          # E402 - Place module level import at the top.
          #        Needed to prevent circular import error
